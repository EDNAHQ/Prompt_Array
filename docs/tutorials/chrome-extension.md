## Overview

The Chrome Extension is a crucial component of Prompt Central that allows users to:
- Access their prompts directly from any webpage
- Manage and organize prompts through a side panel
- Quick access to prompt templates
- Real-time synchronization with the main application

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript/React
- Chrome browser for testing
- npm or yarn package manager

## Project Structure

    └── output.css      # Compiled CSS
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Extension

First, we create the manifest.json file that defines our extension's capabilities:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Prompt Central",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Access and manage your AI prompts directly from any webpage",
  "side_panel": {
    "default_path": "sidepanel.html"
  },
  "permissions": [
    "sidePanel",
    "storage"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Creating the Side Panel Interface

The side panel is implemented using modern web technologies:
- React for the UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for state management

Key implementation details:
- The side panel is loaded through `sidepanel.html`
- React components are mounted in `sidepanel.js`
- Authentication state is managed through `auth.js`

### 3. Authentication Flow

The extension implements a secure authentication flow:
1. User signs in through the main application
2. Auth token is stored securely in Chrome storage
3. Extension uses the token for API requests
4. Auto-refresh mechanism keeps the session alive

### 4. Real-time Synchronization

We implement real-time updates using Supabase's real-time features:
- Subscribe to changes in user's prompts
- Update UI immediately when changes occur
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully

## Advanced Features

### Custom Styling with Tailwind

We use a custom Tailwind configuration for consistent styling:
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: "#4F46E5",
        secondary: "#10B981"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### State Management

The extension uses React Query for efficient state management:
- Caching of frequently used data
- Automatic background refetching
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Testing

We implement several types of tests:
1. Unit tests for core functionality
2. Integration tests for API interactions
3. End-to-end tests for user flows
4. Manual testing checklist

## Deployment

Steps to package and deploy the extension:
1. Build the production version
2. Package the extension
3. Submit to Chrome Web Store
4. Handle updates and versioning

## Best Practices

- Keep manifest.json minimal and only request necessary permissions
- Implement proper error handling
- Use Chrome Storage API efficiently
- Follow Chrome's security guidelines
- Implement proper loading states

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Authentication Issues**
   - Check token storage
   - Verify API endpoints
   - Confirm CORS settings

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Use efficient caching strategies
   - Minimize bundle size

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you can:
1. Customize the UI for your needs
2. Add additional features
3. Implement analytics
4. Add support for other browsers
